Sample Code for Andrew Hamilton

CalculatorAndConverterExamples contains some of the work I have been doing in Android Studio. It currently has screenshots for the Decimal/Hexadecimal/Binary Calculator I have been working on. It also contains the Java and XML file for the main activity of the app, which is the calculator. I plan on adding screenshots and code for the Dec/Hex/Bin converter portion of the app soon.

BlackJackExamples contains screen shots and some of the code written for my final project in GUI Programming.
